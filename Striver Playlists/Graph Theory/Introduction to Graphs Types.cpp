// directed & undirected graphs
// directed -- means direction of edges between vertices
// undirected -- means there is no direction of edges between nodes or vertices

// cycle -- start from a node & end at same node
// acyclic graph is knows as tree

// path -- connect all the vertices & each of them is reachable , a node cannot appear twice in a path

// outdegree -- no of edges going outside the of a node , indegree is vice versa in case of directed graph .

// degree of a node of undirected graph is no of edges attach to it , degree of a whole undirected graph is tiwce the edges

// edge weights -- values of edges in case of weights are not assigned then take it 1
