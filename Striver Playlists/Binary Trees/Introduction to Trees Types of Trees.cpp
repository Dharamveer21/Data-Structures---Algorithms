  Full BT -- every node will either have 0 or 2 children

  Complete BT -- all nodes are completely filled except the last level but the last level last all nodes should be as left as possible

  Perfect BT -- all leaf nodes are at same level

  Balanced Binary Tree -- height can be maximum of log(N) where N is the no of nodes

  Degenerate Trees -- Skew Trees or Skew Matrix -- A Tree who has only one children in the direction either left or right
