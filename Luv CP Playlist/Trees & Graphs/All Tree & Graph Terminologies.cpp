Graph is a collection of vertices & edges
Directional -- edges are directed
Bidirectional -- edges are undirected

Connected components = where there exists a path from each vertex to every other vertex of that component
In case of directed graph -- connected components are called strongly connected components
Collection of connected Components is a forest

Tree is a non cyclic Graph , for given n nodes , there are (n-1) edges in a tree

Leaf nodes -- having no child nodes
Height -- The longest distance of any node from its leaf nodes of its subtree
Depth -- The distance of any node from root node
LCA -- Lowest Common Ancestor -- lowest common parent of the two given nodes
